                <p>
                    Hi! Iâ€™m Dimas Febrian Bomanarakasuraâ€”but just call me <span
                        class="highlight">Boma</span
                    > (or Bomsiwor if you know me from social media). Surprisingly,
                    Iâ€™m not from a computer science background. I studied <span
                        class="highlight">Nuclear Engineering</span
                    > and graduated in 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how did I end up here? <br /> Well, Iâ€™ve loved coding since
                    I was a kid. I used to <span class="highlight">
                        mod PES in
                    </span>Java and <span class="highlight">tweak GTA mods</span
                    > just to see what would happen if I changed a value. I even
                    had a Blogspot blog when I was 10! That curiosity stuck with
                    me through college. I fell in love with <span
                        class="highlight">system engineering fundamentals</span
                    >, studied them deeply, and even became a <span
                        class="highlight">teaching assistant</span
                    > for those courses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve always had a strong drive to catch up with CS
                    studentsâ€”despite not having the same formal education. To
                    bridge the gap, I joined <span class="highlight"
                        >courses, bootcamps, and built side projects</span
                    >. I constantly seek new skills and challenges to grow
                    faster.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the long run, I aim to become a senior engineer, with
                    deep expertise in <span class="highlight"
                        >system engineering and DevOps</span
                    >.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All of thisâ€”my learning journey, my works, and the knowledge
                    I shareâ€”is here in this portfolio. Feel free to explore it,
                    and donâ€™t mind the UIâ€”still working on that part!
