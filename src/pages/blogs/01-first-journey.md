# First Baby step

Hello! Ciao! This is my first step exploring Astro as an astronaut. As we know, this tool (or framework if you prefer) has great capabilities for helping creators and content writers deliver their content without wasting precious time setting up complex boilerplate and configuration. At the same time, retain the flexibility and customizability needed to build a website.

Astro also offers dynamism of incorporating UI Framework such as React, Vue, and more, to create interactivity with no need to setup bundler like Vite or webpack. Astro calls it _island_. An island that floating in the middle of static HTML ocean.

This project utilizes **Typescript** capabilities to maintain code maintainability and ensure type-safety across the project directory. Speaking about UI Framework, so far, this project still uses React as its interactive islands. But i can guarantee, i will mix and match various UI Framework to create islands or simply experiment in the playground. You may not even recognize which part use which framework. Everything is rendered as static HTML with Astro's magic.

By the way, this post is written in markdown. See? you are probably didn't even notice it. Its different with the boring readme.md on github, we can style our markdown.

This site will continue to grow and improve everyday (hyperbolic? No!). So if you encounter any issues while exploring website, don't hesitate to report them to me. I will respond as soon as possible, ideally within 3 days.

I believe **Rome was not built in a night**

Ciao!

Cheers,
Bomanarakasura.
