# First Baby step

Hello! This is my first baby step exploring Astro as an astronaut. As we know about this tool (or framework if you think so) have great capabilities to easing creator and content writer to deliver their content without spending their precious times to setup this and that (boilerplate) and retain the flexibility and customability of building the website.

Astro also offers dinamicity of using other UI Framework such as React, Vue, and many so to create _islands_ with minimal setup stage.

This project is utilizing Typescript capabilities to keep maintainability and type-safety across the project's directory. Speaking about UI Framework, this project still using React as it interactivity island. But I can guarantee, i will mixed up all available UI Framework to create islands or just crafting some toys in playground. You may not recognize which part of this site that use which UI Framework. With Astro's magic, it render all the parts as static HTML.

By the way, this post is written in markdown. See? you aren't noticing which part that giving sign of markdown characteristic as you always see on github `readme.md`.

This site will always growing and refined everyday (hyperbolic? no). So if you found any trouble or problem on your experience exploring this website, don't give hesitate to report it to me. I will respond as soon as possible, whilst i try to respond it within 3 days.

I believe **Rome was not built a night**

Ciao!

Cheers,
Bomanarakasura.
