# Overview

This package allows developers to interact a PHP application with BPJS API on the Trustmark platform. Instead of wasting time writing and dealing with complex logic required for the integration process, developers can focus more on building features.

This package has already been published on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/bomsiwor/php-trustmark) but is still maintained in anticipation of a future policy change. You can take a peek at it on this [repository](https://github.com/bomsiwor/php-trustmark).
